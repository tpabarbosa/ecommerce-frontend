# E-commerce Frontend

This is an example of an e-commerce website frontend that mocks a jersey online store.

It consumes an API served in Node that you can check [here](https://github.com/tpabarbosa/ecommerce-backend).

The main idea for this project was to implement both frontend and backend in less than 15 days, so it's not a complete solution yet.

## ✨ The Code

It was bootstraped with **Create React App** flagged with **typescript** and has those main dependencies installed:

- reack-hook-form
- styled-components
- react-router
- react-icons
- yup
- msw

## ✨ Some Features

- 👤 user register and sign in
- 🛒 shopping cart
- 📋 wishlist
- 📝 products reviews
- 🔍 products search
- 🌚🌞 dark and light modes
